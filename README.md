# Jingle All The Way

Every year on the 24th December, Santa faces the busiest evening of the year as he sets out on a mission to deliver gifts to every corner of the world. Obviously, Santa visits every household in every country, but a slightly more compressed itinerary of his route [has been provided here](https://pastebin.com/RWx85VaS) along with his expected time of arrival in each location (in GMT). Your task is to write an algorithm capable of returning the time remaining until his next destination at any given time during the evening. The use of time/date libraries is allowed.
# Rewards:
:three:   Points are awarded for a working algorithm,

:three:  Further points are awarded for providing a suitable set of unit tests,

:five:   ~~Further points are awarded for displaying a map of Santa's route, along with his current approximate location for any given time during the evening~~.



## Example:
```
Given an input time of  `Sun Dec 25 2022 02:20:00 GMT+0000`,
```
### should return:

```
Arriving in Reykjav√≠k in 10 minutes
```

## Handler function:
```
./src/utils/santaCurrentPosition.js

```
## Install 
```
yarn
```
## Run
```
